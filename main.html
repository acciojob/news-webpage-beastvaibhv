			<p> Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Sikh independence advocate whose killing two months ago 
				is at the centre of a 
				widening breach between India and Canada, was called a human rights activist by 
				Sikh organisations and a criminal by India’s Government.

                Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on September 18 that his government was investigating 
				“credible allegations” that Indian Government agents were linked to the June 18 
				slaying, when Nijjar was gunned down outside a Sikh cultural centre in Surrey, 
				British Columbia.</p>
